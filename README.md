# Profile Generator

## About the Project
This is the first project I have built using Node. After answering a series of prompts, the program will generate a PDF file containing information on about a GitHub profile.

## Styling

All styling for each PDF file can be found in the generateHTML.js file.

## How To Use

To test the project, begin by forking the respoitory.

Next, the user must naviagte to the correct folder in the terminal and run "node index.js". The user will be asked to enter a GitHub username and main color scheme.

Finally, a PDF with the same name as the github profile will generate in the forked folder.
